# /// EPISODE ONE ///
# /// ACT ONE ///
*Lumala's voice. Teenage female speaking*
*Scene: deep sea wind platform*
For centuries, the legends of the Luminara has captivated the minds of explorers and dreamers alike. Whispers tell of their hidden hand, weaving through time’s tapestry—spreading secrets to rulers in shadowed halls, tilting the scales of power, and turning the tides of epic battles. Some say they’ve sculpted the very soul of civilization and philosophy, breathing life into art, literature, and myth.

They're not wrong.

My brothers have woven their way through history, molding it to a perverted version of the vision passed down from the first lum. It's all this world remembers. But it's broken, it's wrong.

My father knew the truth. I've gotta tell it... I've got to get the story out. It might not even matter, but it might matter to someone. That's what Dad would'a done.

My dad would tell me stories of the ancient ways. He said the cycle of life is for the pix to rule, then retire, then rest. Like the waves of the sea, always bringing fresh nutrients to the shore.

Then he'd laugh or cry and mutter about it breaking so easily. Always made me so sad seeing him like that. As he got older, he was like that more and more, but the laughter turned to anger and his crying turned to a defiant stare. 

That defiant stare is the last one I saw. He told me, "Find the pix. Lum Netsach", and then he was gone.

*** SPLINTER INTO SEQUENCE ***
*Lumala's voice*
*Scene: Fly into Splinter logo transition and image/vid sequence*
My name is Lamala.
Today's my birthday! I just turned 17 and beginning the adventure of a lifetime. I'm still feeling the crushing pain of loosing my dad, but I'm driven by a purpose that feels larger than life, and definitely bigger than me and my feelings. Plus, it was my dad who entrusted it to me. 
*** END INTRO SEQUENCE ***

// OPENS ON THE NOTE //

*** NOTE FROM DAD ***
"I'm passing this baton to you most precious one. I'm sorry you'll be caring it alone. I always planned on doing this together when you were older, but we don't often get things how we plan, do we. I've built an 'escape hatch' into my plan so you won't have to do this forever, but until you reach it, this mantel of responsibility is on your capable shoulders. By jove you've been a chip off the o'l block since you were four so I know you've got this. We'll talk soon. This life is but a snap, and the eternity beyond the veil of life makes these pains insignificant. Your life will be long and full of adventure! And when that time does come, I'll be waiting with hugs galore.".

*** END NOTE ***

When he died, I got three very special items... this note, his journal, and a box filled with techie gear (PCB boards, connectors, tools, stuff like that).

*** JOURNAL DESCRIPTION ***
The journal heavy in the hand. It's leather bound with a thick aged leather that shows it's many years of use and wear. The page edges are completely guarded by some kind of metal that seems to seal the journal on every edge. The rectangle locking mechanism is centered on the cover and feels like it's embedded in the leather. Flexible metal straps protrude from each edge of the locking mechanism and wrap tightly around the journal. I can't see any seam in the straps, so they must connect directly into the lock. The locking mechanism is ... {Enter Dimensions with Calipers Later}... It's face is covered with pinholes. Nothing seems to move when I lightly shake it, but I think I can see something in the holes. 

The shape reminds me of something he used to talk about... sooo frustrating... another question I wish I would've asked. Okay, relax, it'll come to you in time. Funny, hearing his voice in my memory brings me such peace. Come on, back to your notes...

The words, "I may be puny, but always remember how I see you augmented by your class." are burned into the leather above the lock. 

[Insert picture of the lock] 

The words, "May incinerate after any wrong choice or tampering." were burned into the leather below the lock in much smaller writing. 

*** END JOURNAL DESCRIPTION ***

Okay, L, let's figure this out. Relax your body, relax your mind. 

*** IN DAD'S VOICE ***
Swim in your memories to discover what you thought was lost and fly in your imagination to create a future not yet arrived. Time travel isn't what you see on TV, it's bridging time with your mind. 
*** END DAD'S VOICE ***

Last year... I remember thinking, 
I know we have money, but he never let us use it. I never felt poor, we always had what we needed, but when I was younger I used to get so mad after hearing "No, it's not for that." so often... never an explanation, just, "It's not for that". Until two days after my 16th birthday, when he sat me down and told me a story.

*** FLASHBACK STORY TOLD BY FALTHER ***

I wanted to do this differently. But looks like I'm not gonna get my way... no sense grumbl'n, but I had such a plan... I can actually see your face seeing it all for the first time... almost every piece in place. 
STOP 
DEEP BREATH
FOCUS
/Takes Lumala's hand/ I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of who you choose to be each and every day. I'm so proud of the person I see you growing into. The day I met your mom was when I found my home, but the day you were born was the day I became alive. I'm not proud of allot of the things I've done in my life, but the fact that I had a hand in you existing as you are today brings me eternal peace, and confidence in my own future beyond the veil.

The next few years are gonna be rough for you most precious one. I need you to focus. Hear my words and listen beyond your emotions.

You know how you've never met your grandparents? Mom and I told you they died before you were born. That's true, but they died over a hundred years before you were born. I'm really old L. If I make it, I'll be 242 years old in 2 months. Focus L. I've been poisoned. Something, somewhere on my last trip... it doesn't even matter. I was going to teach you over years, but now your getting a crash course through tears. It's important you focus. There'll be time to morn, but that's not now. For as long as we have, we work.

He had me emancipate the next day. He said, "I had a plan, but now I need you to be able to stand on your own foundation as soon as possible.". He went over his entire history, all our finances, legal contacts, medical planning, stuff like that, and in exhausting detail. He'd go over a piece, then ask me, "Do you have any questions?", and I'd say, "no", but my head was swimming... I didn't even know where to start. I couldn't get past "he's leaving". After our big talk, he never stopped. He'd leave for days then return with a pile of notes to memorize. After sketching in his journal for hours he'd quiz me on the notes he'd handed me. It's really hard to memorize through tears. I'd choke out some answers and he'd always sit me down, hold my hand, and repeat the same words in the same calming voice...
MOST PRECIOUS ONE
STOP 
DEEP BREATH
FOCUS
Not sure why but even in my emotional chaos that always brought me back to center.

It stayed that way for weeks, Dad moving chess pieces around, returning with notes for me to memorize, he'd sketch, quiz me, then burn the notes. Until those last few days... he'd just gotten to tired to move anymore. We talked. We cried. We sat in silence. Last thing he said was, "Hey, not bad for almost 242 right? I love you more than words can express MPO. Find the pix. Lum Netsach."
Can't tell you how long I cried. I know my head was throbbing and I finally passed out.

*** END FLASHBACK STORY ***
# /// END ACT ONE ///


# /// ACT TWO ///

/WAKING UP NEXT MORNING/

As I wake up I immediately realize he's gone, and in the next instance I also notice the body is gone. He told me it would happen. Just feels so final. And I'm sobbing again. Now that he's gone, I regret every second of silence. There are so many more questions I wish I had asked. I miss you Dad.

// Pass out sobbing //

// Next Morning //

Dad told me to take the next three months to mourn. He was very clear that this would be the only time I'd have with this kind of flexibility for at least the next few years. So...
STOP 
DEEP BREATH
FOCUS
Make this time count, so you jump start the emotional healing process. He also said, "...but you can't put a deadline on mourning and healing MPO. Ya know that saying, 'Man plans and God laughs.'? Well, I see it a little differently. I think it's more like we plan and God sometimes says, 'I've got a better view from here so I'm gonna make a few mods bud.'. Remember those intricately detailed tapestries you loved in Morocco? Do you remember what the back sides looked like? Right, a garbled mess. I think that's what it's like for us. We live our lives in the garbled mess, and only a creator existing outside of time and space can see the art in its complete fullness. My long way around the point is, take three months for focused healing, and be kind to yourself when it's time to focus and get to work. There's no normal when it comes to mourning and healing."

His instructions were his recipe for mourning: Sleep (lots of sleep) + Quality food (in controlled amounts) + Journaling + Ragercise (his word for any kind of workout that depletes all internal anger and prepares you for healing)

// MONTOGE OF CRYING, JOURNALING, SLEEPING, WORKING OUT, EATING WHILE READING w/ VO //
VO
Two hundred years old!
How?
He said he'd tell me more, that he'd answer all my questions, but it'd have to come in pieces now. 
Why? ...so much I don't understand. So much I just don't have the energy to figure out.
...
Wow, rest really is magical. Still hate this feeling, but at least I can dig in a little.
The notes... old stories... they all come in and out of my mind's view.
I remember how he talked about Mom, how he lit up whenever he spoke about her.

*** DAD'S VOICE ***
It wasn't until the Euphrates dig that I had any reason to slow down at all. That's when I met your mom, my sonrisa encantada. Within months of meeting her I knew. I finally had a home. And then you! hahaha You gave our home a reason to be alive! 

Your mom started homeschooling you when you were three! On every dig site and deep sea dive vessel you learned and you always had the best questions and the most interesting ideas. My god how many nights your mom and I feel asleep mesmerized by what you would ask or say. 

You were class three of sonrisa encantada. First, was your mom teaching me to be the kind of precious monster I could be proud of. Second, was me teaching your mom a spot of history. And third, our magnum opus, was you my most precious one.
*** END DAD'S VOICE ***

// END MONTOGE //

Wait a minute!
I just remembered what that reminded me of!! [Speaking of the shape of the locking mechanism on her Dad's journal] It's a punch tape!
Running over to the journal, she picks it up to look at the lock.
Punch tape.

Okay Dad, let's do this... "I may be puny, but always remember how I see you augmented by your class."

*** DAD's VOICE ***
When looking to solve a cryptic, first know the voice that wrote it. Does anything stand out and does it pass the fit and flow test? 

Second, know who it was written for. Is there and special meaning, memories, or agreements?

Third, every lock can be broken with time, data, and consistent effort... every lock.
*** END DAD'S VOICE ***

"I may be puny, but always remember how I see you augmented by your class."

This is obviously for me, so this one should be a sinch. Haha he did love a good pun, but that clearly doesn't fit. What is puny? ... play on words... an augmentation maybe? Alright, well come back to that. "remember how I see you" he loved me... he saw me as precious. But how do you assignment that and why? ... 

//... Some distraction or memory that leads away for a while and relaxed the mind...//

Waking up abruptly and immediately sitting up... Arggg I'm so stupid, punch tape! 
Running to the journal the then running back to bed to get her journal and running back... punch tape punch tape punch tape, as she's searching through her old journal pages, gotcha! 
The game he made up for me, Who For Fit Flow Algo, that's got to be it! I know it is. Okay, let's play Dad. <3 

"I may be puny, but always remember how I see you augmented by your class."
Oh my lord, Dad made it so easy for me... just needed time to see it through the tears, just like he said. It's Punycode. Now this should be easy with punch tape... how many holes? 5 digits. "How I see you augmented by your class." "Augmented" is a multiplier, so that's one digit. I'm obvs class three, so that's another. And he saw me as precious, which he always wrote out as MPO, so "MPO * 3" with Punycode and punch tape output... That's it!
![Pasted image 20241020123753.png](/img/user/Resources/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241020123753.png)
Lumala uses a micro punch to push in and release the correct pins. As she releases the last pin, she hears a subtle 'click' followed by a few seconds of a low whirling noise as the metal straps released and retracted back into the lock. As she reached to open the journal, she was flooded with emotion. She missed him so much. She could feel that her adventure was beginning once she opened the journal, and she wondered if she was ready. Then, her dad's voice came to her again, "We're never ready for the greatest things in our life, because we don't even fully know what we don't know yet. Books, videos, advice... I got as much as I could before you were born, but from that moment I first saw you, I knew none of that mattered. Everything changed... the lights held more color and every sound was lifted by angels. What mattered the day before your birth was now a dull memory. Everything was new. Everything was better."

She smiled at the thought and found comfort how much he loved her. She laughed to herself as see thought, "Okay Dad, let's figure out what I don't know."

And it didn't take long... as she began opening the cover, there was resistance. Not that she expected it to be, but this was no ordinary journal. She's pushed through the resistance and opened the cover flat on the table. Interesting, not a paper journal at all. There was a small handwritten note with Dad's writing loosely laying on a solid thick black object that looked like it was built into the journal and filled almost all of its area. 

The note said, " repeat these words out loud exactly as they're written phonetically. "

I felt the hairs on my arms stand up as I read, "I am lumana offspring of Philippi low d Haus loom"

As she spoke the last word, "lum", her dad's voice from within the journal said, "Vocal imprint recognized and stored. Managing control transferred. Hello Lumala, may I take my most comfortable form?"

Lumala hesitantly replied, "okay", and the block within the journal began transforming. Lumala thought this should be startling, but it felt oddly comforting. Whatever this was, it finally rested in the shape of a tiny octopus. It's legs would meld into each other as it glided across the table, but then whenever it stopped, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, yup octopus, wait, 9, 10, 7... "What are you?"

"Ohh lumala, it's so good to finally be able to talk to you and not hide.", said the little octopus. 

What are you? I mean, who are you... or what, I don't know. I'm so confused. 

I'm sorry, this isn't how we were supposed to meet and your dad thought it'd be easier if the first voice you heard was his. But I can change that if you'd like. 

That's not what's bothering me at this very moment, but thank you. What are you? 

I am... was... your dad's adventure buddy. At least until you were born. He became alive in a way I'd never seen before. Started when he met your mom, but WOW, when you were born... truly beautiful. We still went on adventures, when it wasn't safe for you two to come with, but he made it clear that he had a new adventure buddy. 

I'm sorry

No. Not for a second! I've seen worlds born from dust in the cosmos and societies crumble. There are few things as beautiful as what I saw through your dad's eyes when you came into this world. 


When you're ready, sit and put both of your hands palms up on top of your legs. 

Uuuh what for?

Your dad made it clear that he never wanted full cellular alterations to your genome. Always 100% human, but he did authorize minimal enhancements and cognitive connection with me.

Will it hurt?

It's gonna feel weird, for sure, but not pain as you're used to it. You'll begin feeling different over the next month and the time it takes for you to fully acclimate is different for everyone. The two months you have left of your sacred mourning will be more than enough. You ready to get started? 

Let's do this. 

Lumala sat down and put her hands palms up on top of her legs. She then saw the little octopus begin to push upwards with its arms and float like it was in water. As it scooted in the air toward her she asked, "What should I call you?".

You can call me Ezer or Ez as your dad most often called me. 

As Ez floated above her right palm, Lumala asked, "Sooo Ez, how does this work?"

"Well, all I need to do is make contact and the process will begin. I won't start until you say you're ready. ... ready?"

She did a quick internal SDF, then said, "I'm ready."

With that, Ez gently placed an arm on each finger of her right palm and the others rotated in a circle pattern on the palm. Lumala felt the light pressure of Ez's touch along with a subtle tingling feeling, as if a light electrical charge was starting at her fingertips and slowly moving up to the to of her head. Almost immediately as the feeling reached the top of her head, Ez stopped and floated over to her left hand and duplicated the process exactly like the first. Once Ez completed the process, he floated back to the table, "All done most precious one. We're both gonna need a long rest after that. Hydrate, then lie down quickly... within 15min you won't get to choose where you're lying for the next 12 hours hahaha. I'm gonna have to power down so chop chop."

Lumala chugged some water, washed her face, and just got to the bed when it hit her... lights out! She just got out a, "So this is what yoouuuu m..." as her head hit the pillow. They were both out for 20 hours.


//Over the next two months she learns to navigate her new powers and what it's like to share thoughts with Ez...//
Lumala wakes with a headache and sore muscles, like the day after a triathlon. Her vision feels blurry but also dull in an odd way. As she shuffled to get water and a banana she squished her eyelids shut and rolled her eyes to try and get her eyesight back. She got two bites into the banana when she heard Ez stretch on the table... as he rolled up on his legs, he opened his eyes. Lumala screamed and covered her eyes, her banana and water falling to the floor. Her eyes burned with intensity. Colors she's never seen and pain she never felt. 

It's okay! It's okay! She could hear Ez saying. Your brain's just making sense of all the new connections. The next few weeks are gonna be rough but then we can get to work. 

But my eyes, cried Lumala what's happening? 

"Ohh", Ez answered, "they're remapping the new structures so you can make sense of what you're seeing through me. The first level of that should be ready in a few hours." Ez floated over, peeled her a fresh banana, refilled her water, and led her back to her bed. "For now, just rest MPO."

She lied there with her hands over her eyes and feeling pain she never experienced before. She thought she could actually feel things moving in her eyes and head, but figured it was all muscle spasms. As she tried to make sense of everything and all she was feeling, she remembered something her dad would often say, "It's just pain. A synapse firing to keep me safe. If I know I'm safe and don't need that data, I can simply disregard it. It's trying to do a good job... maybe just a little broken, and broken things are often my very favorite." She smiled just remembering his silly looks and mannerisms as he'd repeat his favorite sayings. No matter how many times I'd hear'm, they always brought me joy. 

//MORE SLEEP//

Next time she woke, she was afraid to open her eyes, but Ez was right there waiting for her. He comforted her with her dad's voice as he said, "Very well done. Keep those eyes closed. Let's start with focusing on what you're able to see with your eyes closed."

Lumala replied, "what?"

Ez, "You heard me. Just do it."

As she slowed her mind, and opened to the impossible, she began to see a light flickering.

Ez asked, "Tell me what you're experiencing."

Lumala explained, "I think I'm seeing different images flickering... maybe cycling, because it seems to be repeating."

"Fantastic!", explained Ez, "Your doing so great! You already recognized it's a cycle. Okay, now I'm gonna stop it cycling."

"Okay... it stopped.", lumala said. 

Ez began to explain, "Now your brain knows there are multiple choices. As you get more skilled at this, you'll be able to visualize multiple modes at the same time, but that's really advanced. Let's start with you understanding the modes available to you. Now remember, your seeing through my eyes for these optional modes, so it's gonna take your brain a bit to get used to that when your eyes are open. Let's start with the easier ones. You can select to visualize heat, precise distance and spacial awareness, vapors and flow, and emulate the view of any living (or previously living) creature. Now, I want you to... ohh you're already doing it... haha show off."

Lumala was speechless. She felt like a comic book character... like Spiderman climbing his first wall... and she started to cry, completely overwhelmed by the joy of seeing the world through the eyes of others. 

Ez interrupted her thoughts, and she didn't care one bit... she wanted more! Ez transitioned his shape into a pair of glasses to ease her brain into the parallax, but told her that once she got used to it, that extra parallax would be helpful for other things. "Baby steps", Ez chuckled out as he watched her burn through his exercises. She truly was made for this. 


// Add more insight here into the training list and some of the training process //

"Wow! Alright, that's the last check on the list before Splinter."

Lumala's excited she did it... many moments she just wanted to give up on herself, but she didn't. But she was also glad for the distraction. "There is no normal with mourning and healing most precious one.", she remembered her dad saying. So let's be kind to ourselves Lumala. That's for sure what Dad would've said. 

Ez continued, "Now it's time you learned about Splinter. She's the cocoon of a Lum. Your dad's plan was for us to all travel to Splinter together and take two to three years training you to be his successor. Splinter is alive. She moves... never in the same place twice, and she can only be found by a Lum. Your dad gave me what you'll need to find her. Of that, he was totally confident, but this is gonna be hard. It was always a challenge for your dad, even after 200 years, sooo yeah."

"Well we better get started then", lumala replied with a great big smile on her face.
# /// END ACT TWO ///



# /// ACT THREE ///


//Then begin the search for splinter//
Lumala woke to Ez anxiously twirling on her nightstand. "Your dad wanted you to hear this directly from him. Guess he felt directly from his pen was the next best."

***PHILLIPI'S NOTE TO LUMALA ABOUT SPLINTER***
Hey MPO 💕 Ezer must believe you're ready to begin your hunt for Splinter if he's given you this note. I'm so sorry I'm not there with you, but I've dreamed of it so often that it feels like we've already done it together hundreds of times. I'm so proud of you. I'm proud of the person you choose to be every day... so loving, kind, hopeful, adventurous, and all with a little dash of rage when required. You are truly my most precious monster.

Here's the tough part. There are others who will always be looking for Splinter. You can NEVER let her be found by anyone but you or your successor (if that time comes). I needed you to hear this from my hand to understand the weight of what I'm about to say. It is better for you to die than Splinter be located by anyone other than you. 

I am a descendant of the first Lum, so you are a descendent of the first Lum. He came to this planet before humans existed. He planted Splinter and gave her the purpose and orders she follows to this day...
- Empower the Lum
- Become undiscoverable by anyone other than the current Lum
- Connect all Lum
- Find the pix 

Intelligent life was already plentiful. As soon as he came across Ez he knew he'd found a friend for life. But he chose this planet because it was clear to him that something very special and rare was about to happen. As it was explained to me, "There are often Therion (animals), but extremely rarely Theriokrator (ruler of all animals), and this is to be treasured, guided, and protected." All are varied and different, but here seems to be common attributes and tendencies within all Theriokrator as they develop. 
One of these most detrimental is the "Šumma zid kauśala"... Randomness of life being interpreted as skill. 
And
Over long periods of time, the perversion of that randomness coalescing an abundance of power among very few.

He befriended Ezer

# Notes 

One of her powers should let her see the interconnections between people.

Deep love... the magic kind of love is willing to do what's best for you while being willing to play a background character's part.

What I think doesn't have to be what you think. Find your own way. Build your own strong foundations. I believe in you and love you.

Look for famous chess matches and use their moves in code.

When lightning strikes, your never promised another.

I'm not completely sure what we are exactly. We've been called many things... giants, witches, vampires, monsters. Funny how humans so often define through fear when they don't understand what they see. The stories of the original Lum speak of outcasts. They believed the universe was a grand playground the creator made for them to explore
other life must exist 
Extraordinary adventurers traveling the galaxy 


The lowest have learned the hardest lessens.


All I went to be remembered for is you. 


Spit out what's sweet in your mouth but makes the stomach bitter, and honor the one who serves you bitter food that's good for your bones.

We have understood great things. Galactic travel, the weaving of time and space, cellular empowerment... but we always understood there was something larger at play. The deeper you peer into the workings of a thing, you'll begin to see the shadows of a maker. And even if you only see someone's shadow, you still know they're there. It seems to me quite immutable, that the more we know, the more we realize we don't. There's such a beauty in that... absolute magic. I call it the magic of large and small. There are very special moments in life when we feel hugely valuable and insignificantly tiny all at the same time. 


Yup Dad, big and small. <3 

Make decisions. You're gonna be wrong many times until your gut fully develops, but wrong is almost always better than indecision. Force a quick SDF, and in that stillness moment hear your gut, then explode in action.

*** END ***

***

Natural talent is a piece of a much larger puzzle. We don't get to pick those. But true fulfilled talent is the result of a level of work most aren't willing to exert. 

A good life, distilled to its most elemental form is a stone with the sides. [Philippi puts a stone in lumala's hand ] The three sided stone is engraved with Diligentia | Eudaimonia | Succurrere one word on each side. In English, Work Hard | Enjoy Life | Help Others. You build a life on that, and you can be at peace.

Work Hard = Diligentia
Enjoy Life = Eudaimonia
Help Others = Succurrere
# Backstory
Lumala was homeschooled from three on. She learned on archeological dig sites and deep sea dive vessels. 

Lumala's dad, Philippi, had always been near her. Until they day be died, he was never out of her life for more than a few days. He loved asking her what she thought about this or that, clearly never tiring of her minds unique way of framing the world. 

The reason I've been able to so easily locate the precise locations for these digs because I've been there. 

It's okay, it's only pain. 

There's so much wisdom in this world. 

Igby 

Strict diet of limitation, exercise, and never skipping on sleep stretches the effects to it's limit. I'll be 242 in a month. 

Tax the rich
Feed the poor
Till there ain't no rich no more

Great guess but they are just really thin letter/number punches they would use to engrave nearly invisible serial numbers into their archeological finds after cleaning them up for purchase. She choose to use the o punch so it wouldn't slip on the little pins inside the lock (she's a smart one).😁

## Concepts I'd like to cover 
- Never Alone: We don't ever accomplish anything great alone. 

- Magic of feeling small and large at the same time.

- Wounds can become superpowers, but until fully healed you can bleed all over the folks around you. 

- Shared cognition... Maybe using Ez as a way to demonstrate it's benefits in our lives with others. 

- Being willing to absolutely suck at something long enough to be great.

- Don't deplete your potential energy by sharing before completion.

- Planned resistance 

# Terms and Maps

## Pix
does the word "pix" mean anything in any of the ancient languages?

Based on the search results, the word "pix" does have meanings in ancient languages, particularly Latin. Here's what we can determine:

## Latin Meaning

In Latin, "pix" is a noun that means "pitch" or "tar"[4]. More specifically:

- It refers to a viscous or sticky substance obtained from the distillation of wood or coal tar[4].
- The full Latin dictionary entry is "pix, picis", indicating its declension[5].

## Etymology

The Latin word "pix" has an interesting etymology:

- It comes from Proto-Italic **piks*, which is suggested to have developed from an earlier form **pitks*[2].
- The Proto-Indo-European root is believed to be **pī́t-k-s* or *pit-k-és*, derived from **pī́ts* meaning "resin" plus a suffix *-ks*[2].
- This etymology links "pix" to words related to pine trees, as pine resin was a common source of pitch in ancient times[2].

## Pronunciation

In Classical Latin, "pix" was pronounced as /piks/ or [pɪks̠][2].

## Other Ancient Uses

While not strictly an ancient language usage, it's worth noting that "pix" also appeared as an obsolete spelling of "pyx" in Late Middle English through the 19th century[2]. A pyx is a small container used in Christian churches to carry the Eucharist[3].

It's important to note that while "pix" has these ancient meanings, in modern contexts it's often used as an abbreviation for "pictures," but this usage dates only to the early 20th century and is unrelated to the ancient meanings[2].

## Ancient words for Forever
Here's a list of ancient words and phrases that convey ideas similar to "forever," each with background on its origin and meaning:

1. Aeternitas (Latin):

Meaning: Eternity, everlasting, without end.

Background: In Roman culture, aeternitas often symbolized the idea of endless time or divine immortality. The concept was also personified as a deity, representing the eternal nature of the Roman Empire.



2. Aión (Greek: Αἰών):

Meaning: An age, a life force, an eternity.

Background: In ancient Greek, aión originally referred to a long period or "age" but evolved to mean eternity or an unending existence. Philosophers and early Christians used this word to describe an eternal lifespan beyond human comprehension.



3. Nfr Nhh (Ancient Egyptian):

Meaning: Beautiful eternity.

Background: This phrase was often used in Egyptian tombs and inscriptions to signify an everlasting afterlife. The Egyptians viewed eternity as a realm or state that was beautiful and perfect, extending endlessly.



4. Dṛgham Āyur (Sanskrit: दीर्घं आयुर्):

Meaning: Long life, eternal life.

Background: Found in Vedic texts and often associated with blessings, dṛgham āyur implied a life so long that it approached the idea of eternity. It conveys both literal longevity and a timeless, divine existence in Hindu traditions.



5. Netsach (Hebrew: נֵצַח):

Meaning: Forever, victory, eternity.

Background: In Hebrew, netsach signifies both eternity and enduring triumph. It's used in the Hebrew Bible to describe something that lasts perpetually, reflecting a sense of invincibility and unending duration.



6. Ananta (Sanskrit: अनन्त):

10. Al-Dahr (Arabic: الدهر):

Meaning: Time, unchanging eternity.

Background: In classical Arabic, al-dahr represented the eternal flow of time. The term is often seen in Islamic texts and poetry to suggest that all things are ultimately subject to the passage of time, which is timeless and constant.

## Sayings from ancient languages that could be delivered from the letters findthepix 

Given the letters "findthepix," let’s see if any relevant phrases or ancient words might be created by rearranging or loosely interpreting these letters. However, forming an exact match with only these letters is quite challenging for ancient sayings, but here are some creative interpretations and adaptations based on their meanings and symbols.

1. In Latin or Latin-inspired:

“Finis pietate”: loosely derived from “finis” (end) and “pietate” (piety or devotion), this could translate as "end in devotion" or "devotion to the end." It’s a reflective phrase about eternal devotion or commitment, potentially hinting at the idea of something that endures.



2. Greek-inspired:

“Pheidon” (Φείδων): This is a historical Greek name meaning "thrifty" or "careful," associated with an ancient ruler. While not directly meaning "forever," it suggests endurance through wise preservation. The letters almost spell it, and it could be a symbolic interpretation of "lasting value."



3. “Finithepex” (Creative Latin blend):

Using a mix of Latin-rooted words, this could represent fini (limit, end) combined with pex from "pecto," meaning to bind or weave. This creative phrase could imply "bound to the end" or something woven through time, symbolizing lasting continuity.



4. Old English-inspired:

“Heptin Fide”: An invented phrase playing with the Old English concept of fide (faith, loyalty) and hept (a stretch from heap meaning to collect or keep together), suggesting something like "bound in faith" or “held in loyalty.” This reflects an eternal commitment.



5. Hebrew-inspired:

“Eiph Neth”: Borrowing from Hebrew sounds, this fictional phrase resembles words meaning "forever" (netzach) and the divine (El). A phrase like this could imply a boundless or eternal connection to divinity.




These phrases are somewhat imaginative, given the constraint of exact letters, but each could evoke a sense of timelessness and continuity. Let me know if you'd like more exact translations or other creative arrangements!

WORK HARD
are there ancient words that mean "work hard"

There are indeed ancient words and phrases that convey the concept of "working hard" or "diligence in labor." One of the most well-known examples comes from Latin:

## Labor Omnia Vincit

This Latin phrase translates to "Work conquers all" or "Hard work overcomes all things"[1][4]. It has its origins in ancient Roman literature:

- Derived from Virgil's Eclogue X.69, which originally stated "Omnia vincit Amor" ("Love conquers all")
- A similar phrase appears in Virgil's Georgics I.145
- Written around 29 BC as part of Virgil's series of poems called the "Georgics"

The phrase has gained widespread use as a motto, appearing in various contexts:

- Motto of several educational institutions, including St. Xavier's Institution in Penang and Brinkworth Area School in South Australia
- Motto of the American Federation of Labor and the State of Oklahoma
- Used by several British noble families and towns

## Other Ancient Concepts

While not single words, other classical languages had ways to express hard work:

- In Greek philosophy, the concept of **ponos** (πόνος) referred to hard labor or toil
- The Roman virtue of **industria** emphasized diligence and hard work

## Related Terms

Latin had several words related to diligence and effort:

- **Diligentia**: meaning attentiveness, carefulness, or steady effort[3]
- **Laborare**: to work or labor
- **Conari**: to endeavor or strive

These ancient concepts of hard work and diligence have influenced many languages and cultures, emphasizing the timeless value placed on dedicated effort and perseverance.

ENJOY LIFE
it's there a single word rather than a phrase that means "enjoy life" in ancient languages?

Yes, there is a single ancient Greek word that closely aligns with the concept of "enjoy life" - eudaimonia.

Eudaimonia (εὐδαιμονία) is an ancient Greek word that encompasses the idea of living well and flourishing[1][4]. While it is often translated simply as "happiness," its meaning is much richer and more nuanced. Eudaimonia represents a state of well-being, contentment, and fulfillment that goes beyond momentary pleasure[4].

## Meaning and Context

Eudaimonia was a central concept in ancient Greek philosophy, particularly emphasized by Plato and Aristotle[4]. It can be understood as:

1. A state of human flourishing or prosperity
2. Living in accordance with one's highest potential
3. Achieving the highest human good

Unlike the modern concept of happiness, which often focuses on pleasure or positive emotions, eudaimonia encompasses a broader sense of life satisfaction and well-lived existence[1]. It acknowledges that a fulfilling life may include challenges and periods of difficulty while still being worthwhile overall.

## Philosophical Significance

Aristotle used eudaimonia as the term for the highest human good in his works[1]. He argued that true fulfillment comes not just from momentary pleasures, but from living virtuously and realizing one's full potential as a human being.

The concept of eudaimonia offers a more holistic view of well-being than simply "enjoying life" in a hedonistic sense. It suggests that a truly good life involves not just pleasure, but also meaning, purpose, and the cultivation of virtue.

While eudaimonia may not translate directly to "enjoy life" in the casual, everyday sense, it captures a deeper and more comprehensive idea of what it means to live well and find fulfillment - which could be considered the ultimate form of enjoying life.

HELP OTHERS
Is there a single word rather than a phrase that means "help others" in ancient languages?

While there isn't a single word that precisely means "help others" in most ancient languages, there are some terms that come close to conveying this concept:

## Latin

The closest Latin term would be "succurrere," which means "to run to the aid of" or "to help"[4]. This verb captures the essence of helping others, especially in times of need. It's often used in the phrase "succurrere hominibus," meaning "to run to the aid of people" or "to help people"[4].

## Ancient Greek

In Ancient Greek, the phrase "Ζεῦ σῶσον!" (Zdeú sōson!) was used as an exclamation meaning "Zeus, save us!" or "Help!"[3]. While this is not a single word, it's a concise phrase that invokes divine assistance for others.

## Hebrew

The Hebrew word "הצילו!" (atsiloo!) is an exclamation meaning "Help!" or "Save!"[3]. Although it's not specifically about helping others, it's often used in contexts where assistance is needed for someone else.

It's worth noting that the concept of altruism, which is closely related to helping others, is a relatively modern term. The word "altruism" was coined in the 19th century by French sociologist Auguste Comte[1][2]. In ancient cultures, similar concepts were often expressed through terms related to charity, kindness, or divine assistance rather than a single word meaning "help others."

single ancient word meaning "helper" or "companion"

An ancient word meaning "helper" or "companion" can be found in several languages with rich historical contexts:

1. **Koinonos (κοινωνός)**: This is an Ancient Greek word that generally means "companion." It was used extensively in ancient writings to refer to a partner, whether in marriage, business, friendship, or faith. The term emphasizes sharing and partnership[3].

2. **Boēthos (βοηθός)**: In Greek, this word means "helper" and is used in contexts that imply strength and rescue. It appears in the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, known as the Septuagint, where it translates the Hebrew word *ezer* (עֵזֶר), which also means "help" or "helper"[4][5].

3. **Ezer (עֵזֶר)**: In Hebrew, *ezer* is used in the Old Testament to denote a strong form of help or support, often in life-threatening situations. It is notably used in Genesis 2:18 to describe the role of Eve as a "helper" to Adam, implying an essential partnership rather than a subordinate role[5].

These words illustrate how ancient languages encapsulated the concepts of help and companionship, often highlighting mutual support and partnership.

is there an ancient word for "dominant animal" that could possible refer to humanity?

Based on the search results and etymological information provided, there isn't a specific ancient word that directly translates to "dominant animal" referring to humanity. However, we can construct a term using ancient Greek roots that could convey this meaning. 

The most appropriate term we can derive from ancient Greek would be "therioanthropos" (θηριάνθρωπος). This compound word combines two key elements:

1. "Therion" (θηρίον): This word means "wild animal" or "beast"[3]. It's derived from "ther" (θήρ), which refers to any kind of wild animal, especially those that were commonly hunted.

2. "Anthropos" (ἄνθρωπος): This means "human being" or "man" (in the sense of humankind).

By combining these elements, "therioanthropos" could be interpreted as "beast-man" or "animal-human," which could imply a dominant or superior animal-like human.

It's worth noting that this term is not attested in ancient Greek literature, but it follows the pattern of word formation in the language. The concept aligns with the idea of humans as the dominant species, combining our animal nature with our unique human characteristics.

Alternatively, if we want to emphasize the dominance aspect, we could consider using the root "krat-" (κρατ-) from "kratos" (κράτος), meaning "power" or "strength"[2]. This gives us:

- Theriokrator (θηριοκράτωρ): "beast-ruler" or "animal-dominator"

These constructed terms, while not historically used, could serve as a scientifically plausible way to describe humanity as the dominant animal species in a fictional or worldbuilding context.

Creating a phrase in extremely ancient languages to convey the idea of "Randomness of life foolishly interpreted as skill" would involve drawing from multiple linguistic traditions. Here's how this might be approached:

Step 1: Decompose the Idea

Randomness of life: Ideas of randomness or chance often relate to fate or fortune in ancient languages.

Foolishly interpreted: This involves misunderstanding or misjudging, often connected with folly or ignorance.

Skill: Skill might be described in terms of craft, ability, or knowledge.


Step 2: Identify Ancient Language Roots

Here are a few potential sources:

Sumerian: One of the first written languages.

Akkadian: Used in Mesopotamia, it has rich vocabulary for fate and wisdom.

Ancient Greek: Offers nuanced philosophical terms.

Sanskrit: Rich in metaphysical and philosophical ideas.

Latin: Often used for abstractions.


Step 3: Combine Words

Here’s a possible reconstruction using simplified forms and meanings:

1. Randomness/Chance:

Sumerian: Šumma (related to divination, fate)

Greek: Tyche (chance, fortune)

Latin: Fortuna (luck, fate)



2. Life:

Sumerian: Zid (life, breath)

Sanskrit: Jīva (life, living being)



3. Foolishness:

Greek: Mōria (folly)

Latin: Stultitia (foolishness)



4. Skill:

Greek: Technē (craft, skill)

Sanskrit: Kauśala (skill, art)




Suggested Combination:

From Greek and Latin:
"Tyche mōria technē"
(Chance as foolishness interpreted as skill)

From Sumerian and Sanskrit:
"Šumma zid kauśala"
(Randomness of life mistaken for skill)

How It Works:

Each phrase is a succinct attempt to encapsulate the idea by combining roots with deep cultural meanings.

Phonetic combinations depend on style and purpose (e.g., poetic, philosophical, mystical).
