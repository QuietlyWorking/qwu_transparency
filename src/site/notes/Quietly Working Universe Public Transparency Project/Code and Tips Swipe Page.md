# Code and Tips Swipe Page
## What, Why, Who for & WARNING!
*To support our guiding value of #transparency and to create a legacy knowledgebase for our #MP scholars, we thought it wise to begin combining our many swipe pages, code clips, hotkey sheets, and tips into one combined database. This will grow and I imagine eventually include an easy way for others to add. But for now, baby steps ;).*

If you don't know what a specific style element does, google it and test it out. If it doesn't work for you, remove it, but this is a fantastic way to learn. It's also helpful to take notes as you're going, so you can put things back or trace your footsteps if you get an undesired result. This is not for production environments, but I love to learn by breaking things. ;)

From here on out, the process is similar for other elements you'd like to change.

But here's another reminder... this is all off book, meaning that GoBrunch devs could make a change tomorrow and all your customizations are gone or not working the same. Have fun, but understand these are not GoBrunch supported operations.
