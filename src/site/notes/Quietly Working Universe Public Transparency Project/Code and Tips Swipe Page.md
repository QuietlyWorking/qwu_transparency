## What, Why, Who for & WARNING!
*To support our guiding value of #transparency and to create a legacy knowledgebase for our #MP scholars, we thought it wise to begin combining our many swipe pages, code clips, hotkey sheets, and tips into one combined database. This will grow and I imagine eventually include an easy way for others to add. But for now, baby steps ;).*
**WARNING: This body of knowledge is not actively kept up-to-date. We enjoy and encourage breaking things to learn, so use any code with that understanding. Please test before putting into any kind of production environment. We also can't provide help or support, so use at your own risk.**
