## Purpose


## Sketch


## Usage

- Appointments: All of our Quietly Working online meetings will be held in the OMW.
	- When someone with an appointment enters the lobby, they are welcome to enter their prepared room up to 15 minutes before their scheduled meeting time. 
	- To enter their meeting room, they simply click on their name (or business name) on the "Today's Meetings" welcome sign.
	- If a visitor doesn't see their name (or business name) on the "Today's Meetings" welcome sign, and they believe they have a meeting scheduled, then the Super Grover chat bot should,
		1. Ask who they had a meeting with?
		2. And offer to get ahold of that person.
